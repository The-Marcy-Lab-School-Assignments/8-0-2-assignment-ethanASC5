# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
 Environment variables are key-value pairs used to configure applications at runtime. They are used to store sensitive information like API keys. 


***********REVISED************


The environment variable is a hidden variable on the host machine, which is our laptops. It is accessible in Node through the "process.env" object.
