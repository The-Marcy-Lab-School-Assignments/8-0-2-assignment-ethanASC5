# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
One danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend is that users could access sensitive data or perform unauthorized operations, depending on the APIâ€™s scope

The way that making API request from the server avoids this danger is by creating a layers of protection.  


**************REVISED**********

The danger of making API requests with API key from the frontend is that you can accidentally leak your API key. The  client can see that key on their side and if they have bad intentions the client can use it to do illegal activities under your name. Making a API request from the server avoids this because the user cannot see the backend, the backend is only avaliable to the engineer, so the API key will be safe.



# Teacher Feedback

You are correct in that the danger of making API requests from the frontend is that other users could access the API key and perform unauthorized actions. 

In your response, be more specific in the layer of protection you mentioned. Where do we see that layer, what are we using to hide our API Key?
